    <h1>Git Hub Instructions</h1>

    <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">Git Hub</a> and signup for an account</p>

   <p> Go through all the information and create a new repository. It will have a clone address that you will want to copy.</p>

   <p>Download Git by going to : <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a> and downloading the version for windows.</p>

   <p>Install that and you should be ready to connect your github to VSCode.</p>

   <p>Restart VS Code to make sure that Git is recognized in the terminal.</p>

   <p>Make sure your folder is opened in VS Code. Then Click Terminal at the top and select New Terminal</p>

   <p>type in <code>git clone </code> and then right click after you have the address copied from your repository.</p>

   <p>then type in <code>git config --global user.name "YourUserName"</code></p>

   <p>then type in <code>git config --global user.email "YourUserEmail"</code></p>

   <p>This should link your account to the your repository.</p>

   <p>On the left side of VSCode you should see the source control icon. Looks like 3 dots that are conencted.</p>

   <p>This will track all of your changes and this is where you can push or pull files to github so that they can be accessed anywhere.</p>

   <p>Questions anyone?</p>
